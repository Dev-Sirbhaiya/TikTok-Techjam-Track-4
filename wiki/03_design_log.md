# 03 — Design Log (Chronological Narrative)

Free-form, dated, append-only. This is where "we tried X, it broke because Y, switched to Z" lives
— the texture that a table of decisions loses. Codex review findings and how they were resolved
also get logged here (with a link to the full report under `reviews/`).

## 2026-08-26 — Project scaffolding

- Read and digested the four source docs (`Tiktok_Problem.md`, `Amazon_Dataset_Description.md`,
  `Important_Links.md`, `Tiktok_Mail.md`). Confirmed this is TechJam 2026 Track 4 (Shopping
  Copilot / conversational search), 72-hour build window 2026-08-29 → 2026-09-01.
- Initialized git repo at project root (was not a repo before).
- Verified local tooling: `git 2.49.0`, `python 3.13.7`, `codex-cli 0.147.0` all present.
- Built the living wiki (this directory) and the CLAUDE.md / status.md enforcement rules that keep
  it authoritative across sessions. See DD-001.
- Kicked off import of external resources (participant repo + release kit) and Python venv setup —
  see [07_external_resources.md](07_external_resources.md) for outcome.
- No solution architecture decisions made yet — Pillars I–III design starts once the participant
  kit (starter agent, evaluator, API contract) has been inspected.
